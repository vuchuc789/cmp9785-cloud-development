Since certificates signed by Google often take time to set up, you can speed up repeated `terraform apply` runs by removing the certificate resources before destroying the infrastructure and importing them again before applying. Furthermore, Google Certificate Manager offers the first 100 domains for free, so you donâ€™t need to worry about the cost.

```
terraform import module.google.google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization.default projects/cmp9785/locations/europe-north2/dnsAuthorizations/cmp9785-dnsauth

terraform import module.google.google_certificate_manager_certificate.root_cert projects/cmp9785/locations/europe-north2/certificates/cmp9785-rootcert
```
